# Designing a High-Throughput MQTT Subscriber for a Python Package

## 1. Introduction
This document provides a structured approach for designing an MQTT subscriber that runs in the background and efficiently handles high message rates. The goal is to create a package that seamlessly integrates into user applications—whether synchronous or asynchronous—without requiring users to manage concurrency explicitly.

## 2. Key Design Considerations
A well-designed background process must address:
- **Concurrency Model**: Should the subscriber use threads, asyncio, or multiprocessing?
- **Performance**: How can it handle high message rates (>10 messages per second)?
- **User Experience**: How should the API be designed for ease of use?
- **Thread Safety**: How to prevent blocking and data loss?
- **Scalability**: Can the system handle message bursts efficiently?

## 3. Concurrency Model
The two most common approaches for running a background task in Python are:
- **Threads (`threading`)**: Works well for I/O-bound tasks such as MQTT, though slow callbacks can block.
- **Asyncio (`asyncio`)**: Enables non-blocking execution but can conflict if the user’s application already runs an event loop.
- **Hybrid Approach (Recommended)**: Use threads by default, but allow integration with `asyncio`.

### What Happens If the User Uses Asyncio?
- If an asyncio loop is already running, forcing a separate event loop can cause conflicts.
- The system should detect if an asyncio loop is active and adjust behavior accordingly.
- If the callback is an `async def`, messages should be dispatched using `asyncio.create_task()`.

## 4. Handling High Message Rates
To avoid blocking operations in a high-throughput system, the design includes:

1. **Message Queue (`queue.Queue`)**:
   - Buffers incoming messages to prevent blocking the MQTT loop.
   - Allows separate processing to improve throughput.
   - Ensures messages are not lost if processing is slow.

2. **Thread Pool (`ThreadPoolExecutor`)**:
   - Processes messages concurrently.
   - Prevents a slow callback from blocking the system.

3. **Rate-Limiting & Backpressure**:
   - Discards older messages if the arrival rate exceeds processing capacity.
   - Warns the user when the message queue reaches capacity.

## 5. Implementation

### 5.1 API: Simple for the User
The user should be able to create and start the subscriber with a single call:

```python
subscriber = MQTTSubscriber(broker="mqtt.example.com", topic="test", callback=print)
subscriber.start()
```

### 5.2 Code Implementation

```python
import threading
import asyncio
import queue
import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

class MQTTSubscriber:
    def __init__(self, broker, topic, callback, max_queue_size=1000, worker_threads=4):
        self.broker = broker
        self.topic = topic
        self.callback = callback
        self.queue = queue.Queue(maxsize=max_queue_size)
        self.client = mqtt.Client()
        self.client.on_message = self._on_message
        self._mqtt_thread = None
        self._worker_threads = worker_threads
        self._stop_event = threading.Event()
        self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=worker_threads)

    def _on_message(self, client, userdata, message):
        """Handles incoming MQTT messages and queues them for processing."""
        try:
            payload = message.payload.decode()
            self.queue.put_nowait(payload)
        except queue.Full:
            print("Warning: Message queue full, dropping message.")

    def _run_mqtt(self):
        """Runs the MQTT client loop in a background thread."""
        self.client.connect(self.broker)
        self.client.subscribe(self.topic)
        self.client.loop_forever()

    def _worker(self):
        """Worker function to process messages from the queue."""
        while not self._stop_event.is_set():
            try:
                message = self.queue.get(timeout=1)
                if asyncio.iscoroutinefunction(self.callback):
                    asyncio.run(self.callback(message))
                else:
                    self._executor.submit(self.callback, message)
            except queue.Empty:
                continue

    def start(self):
        """Starts the MQTT subscriber and worker threads."""
        if self._mqtt_thread and self._mqtt_thread.is_alive():
            print("Subscriber already running.")
            return

        try:
            asyncio.get_running_loop()
            print("Warning: Detected asyncio event loop. Consider using an async callback.")
        except RuntimeError:
            pass

        self._mqtt_thread = threading.Thread(target=self._run_mqtt, daemon=True)
        self._mqtt_thread.start()

        for _ in range(self._worker_threads):
            threading.Thread(target=self._worker, daemon=True).start()

    def stop(self):
        """Stops the subscriber and cleans up threads."""
        self._stop_event.set()
        self.client.disconnect()
        self._executor.shutdown(wait=True)
```

## 6. Why This Approach?

- **Works Out-of-the-Box**: Runs in a background thread by default; users do not need to manage threading or asyncio.
- **Async-Friendly**: Detects asyncio loops and integrates async callbacks; warns users to handle event loops properly.
- **High Throughput**: Uses a message queue and worker threads for parallel processing.
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Ensures all threads terminate and resources are cleaned up.

## 7. Example Usage

### Synchronous Callback (Multi-threaded)

```python
def process_message(msg):
    print(f"Received: {msg}")

subscriber = MQTTSubscriber(broker="mqtt.example.com", topic="test", callback=process_message)
subscriber.start()
```

### Asynchronous Callback

```python
import asyncio

async def async_process_message(msg):
    print(f"Received (async): {msg}")

subscriber = MQTTSubscriber(broker="mqtt.example.com", topic="test", callback=async_process_message)
subscriber.start()
```

## 8. Warnings & Considerations

- **Asyncio Detected**:
  - Warn: "Detected asyncio event loop. Consider using an async callback."
  - *Recommendation*: Provide an async callback if running an event loop.

- **Message Queue Full**:
  - Warn: "Message queue full, dropping message."
  - *Recommendation*: Increase `max_queue_size` or optimize the callback.

- **Worker Threads Overloaded**:
  - If processing is slower than message arrival, consider increasing `worker_threads`.

## 9. Embedding an MQTT Broker

For scenarios where the application also needs to host the MQTT broker, the design can be extended to include an embedded broker. Running the broker in a separate thread ensures isolation and better resource management. A manager class can be used to coordinate the lifecycle of both the broker and subscriber.

### Manager Class Approach

```python
import threading

class MQTTManager:
    def __init__(self, broker_config, subscriber_config):
        self.broker_config = broker_config
        self.subscriber_config = subscriber_config
        self.broker_thread = None
        self.subscriber = None
        self._broker_stop_event = threading.Event()

    def start_broker(self):
        def run_broker():
            # Replace the following with actual broker startup code
            from my_mqtt_broker import run_broker_loop
            run_broker_loop(stop_event=self._broker_stop_event, config=self.broker_config)
        
        self.broker_thread = threading.Thread(target=run_broker, daemon=True)
        self.broker_thread.start()
        print("Broker started.")

    def start_subscriber(self):
        from my_mqtt_subscriber import MQTTSubscriber  # Replace with actual import if needed
        self.subscriber = MQTTSubscriber(**self.subscriber_config)
        self.subscriber.start()
        print("Subscriber started.")

    def start(self):
        self.start_broker()
        self.start_subscriber()

    def stop(self):
        # Stop the broker
        self._broker_stop_event.set()
        if self.broker_thread:
            self.broker_thread.join()
        # Stop the subscriber
        if self.subscriber:
            self.subscriber.stop()
        print("MQTT Manager stopped.")
```
