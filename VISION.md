# Vision

## Purpose

MQTT Data Bridge solves common challenges in Axis device MQTT integration by providing a single, focused tool that:
- Sets up and manages MQTT communication with Axis devices
- Handles device configuration and data collection
- Provides both broker and client capabilities in one instance
- Records and replays device interactions for testing and development

## Core Capabilities

The tool combines three essential functions:
1. **MQTT Management** - Either connects to existing brokers or provides its own
2. **Axis Integration** - Handles device-specific protocols and data formats
3. **Data Handling** - Records, stores, and replays device interactions

## Key Features

**MQTT Operations**
- Built-in broker for standalone operation
- Client capabilities for external broker connection
- Concurrent broker/client operation in single instance

**Axis Device Support**
- Device discovery and configuration
- Event and data stream processing
- Command and control interfaces
- Protocol adaptation for different device types

**Data Management**
- Message recording and playback
- Structured data storage
- Interaction history for debugging

## Practical Applications

The tool directly supports common Axis device scenarios:
- Setting up new devices with MQTT capability
- Monitoring device events and status
- Testing device integrations without external dependencies
- Managing multiple devices through a single interface

## Design Philosophy

MQTT Data Bridge focuses on solving real problems in Axis device integration, favoring practical solutions over generic frameworks. It combines necessary MQTT capabilities with specific Axis device support, providing exactly what's needed for effective device management - no more, no less.
