# Vision

## Purpose

MQTT Data Bridge solves common challenges in Axis device MQTT integration by providing a single, focused tool that:
- Sets up and manages MQTT communication with Axis devices
- Handles device configuration and data collection
- Records and replays device interactions for testing and development

## Core Capabilities

The tool combines three essential functions:
1. **MQTT Management** - Either connects to existing brokers or provides its own
2. **Axis Integration** - Handles device-specific protocols and data formats
3. **Data Handling** - Records, stores, and replays device interactions

## Key Features

* Set up and configure an Axis Device to start publishing analytics data to an MQTT broker
* Set up a subscription to receive analytics data sent to the Broker
* Record and Replay interactions between the Device and the Broker
